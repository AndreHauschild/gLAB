  MESSAGES FORMAT
    INFO
        INFO messages are shown at several points in the program and provide information on the
          program configuration, events and problems it may encounter, which are:

             At the start of the file, showing information about gLAB configuration.
             An inconsistent clock update on the receiver.
             A data gap in the RINEX observation file.
             A change in the a priori receiver coordinates (only when receiver coordinates are computed by gLAB).
             The new position to be used from the reference position file (only when a reference file is provided).
             No solution was computed, along with the reason for not being able to compute the
                solution (not enough satellites available, singular geometry matrix or DOP too high).
             In SBAS processing, the elevation of each GEO and the one selected (if GEO selection with highest
                elevation is enabled).
             In SBAS processing, a GEO or mode switch.
             In SBAS processing, if option '-mode:selectbestgeo' is enabled, in each epoch, for each GEO which a
               solution can be computed, the GEO PRN, its protection levels and a message if the GEO was selected is
               printed. The selected GEO will be always the last one.
             In DGNSS processing, a switch from DGNSS to SPP solution mode.
             In DGNSS processing, a data gap in the reference station RINEX observation file.

        An unconsistency is triggered when field 15 is greater than field 20. In this case, all satellites samples are skipped (it is considered as a
          data gap but without triggering N-consecutive check) Consistency check cannot be triggered two consecutive epochs.

        The cycle-slip flag in field 22 will only be enabled if the single frequency detector detects a cycle-slip, but not if another cycle-slip
          running in parallel detects a cycle-slip trigger and the single frequency detector doesn't.

        A cycle-slip is triggered when fields 19 and 20 are greater than field 21 and the square root of field 18 is smaller than field 22 or
          if field 18 is greater than ten times field 22.
        The first time a cycle-slip is detected, the samples are considered as 'outlier' and samples are skipped (it is considered as data gap but
          without triggering N-consecutive check). If the next sample a cycle-slip is triggered, then a new arc is declared. Otherwise, if no
          cycle-slip is detected the next epoch, the arc continues with the previous epoch skipped
        The cycle-slip flag in field 24 will only be enabled if the Melbourne-Wubbena detector detects a cycle-slip, but not if another cycle-slip
          running in parallel detects a cycle-slip trigger and the Melbourne-Wubbena detector doesn't.

        A cycle-slip is triggered when field 15 is greater than field 19 or field 17 is greater than fields 18 and 20. If a cycle-slip
          is declared with the first condition, no outlier is declared, as it is a check for large phase jumps. If a cycle-slip triggers
          with the second condition, an outlier is declared. If in the next epoch a cycle-slip is triggered, then a new arc is declared.
          Otherwise, if no cycle-slip is detected the next epoch, the arc continues with the previous epoch skipped.
        The cycle-slip flag in field 22 will only be enabled if the geometry-free detector detects a cycle-slip, but not if another cycle-slip
          running in parallel detects a cycle-slip trigger and the geometry-free detector doesn't.

        A cycle-slip is triggered when field 17 is greater than field 21 or field 19 is greater than fields 20 and 22. If a cycle-slip
          is declared with the first condition, no outlier is declared, as it is a check for large phase jumps. If a cycle-slip triggers
          with the second condition, an outlier is declared. If in the next epoch a cycle-slip is triggered, then a new arc is declared.
          Otherwise, if no cycle-slip is detected the next epoch, the arc continues with the previous epoch skipped.
        The cycle-slip flag in field 24 will only be enabled if the iono-geometry-free detector detects a cycle-slip, but not if another cycle-slip

         	For other constellations value is 0
        The satellite coordinates (fields 21-26) are given in the transmission epoch if the model of the
          signal transmission time is enabled (if it is disabled, they are given in the reception
          time). The coordinates are relative to the antenna phase centre or satellite mass centre,
          depending on the products input:
            * Broadcast: Antenna Phase Centre
            * Precise: Satellite Mass Centre
        Field 19 is the direct measurement (as in the RINEX file), but scaled to metres for carrier phase
          measurements. Field 48 is the model computed for this measurement, which is the direct sum of fields 27 to 47.
        When the '*' appears in field 1, it is due to smoothed code of the satellite has not reached steady-state, a SBAS processing mode switch
          or SBAS GEO switch. When a mode or GEO switch occurs, the SBAS corrections have to be computed again.
        The SNR value in field 49 may be any of these values (in this order): the "S" measurement in the
          observation file, or if it is not present, it will be the SNR flag in the current measurement (converted to numerical value).
          If no SNR is available, 999 will be printed in this field.

             Number of epochs skipped (epochs without solution) in total and per each possible reason for skipping the epoch.
             Number of epochs missing during the summary period (if decimation is enabled, the epochs missing
               will be separated into the epochs which would have been decimated or not decimated.

             The number of not used satellites (in total and per constellation) mean value, 50 and 95 percentile (or user defined percentile). User unselected satellites will not count as not used.
             The maximum and minimum number of satellites used (in total and per constellation) and the epochs were it ocurred.
             The maximum and minimum number of satellites not used (in total and per constellation) and the epochs were it ocurred. User unselected satellites will not count as not used.

               In the non-mutithread version of gLAB, the processing times are provided by the system function that provided thread CPU time.
               In multi-thread version of gLAB, the CPU time provided by the system function is the sum of all CPU time of all threads, which
                can yield a total time greater than than the real time (user perceived time) passed. In this case, gLAB will show the real time
                passed (but using the user and Kernel time percentages from the system functions).
               The processing time is computed just at the end of the summary, where still the print with the processing time and the last line of
                the summary are to be done, and also the last lines of gLAB code which are for freeing memory. These last instructions add less
                than 1ms of processing time for user time and less than to 0.2 seconds of Kernel time.

          If observation file starts at 22 hours or later, gLAB will automatically assume that all the epochs until the start of the next day (midnight)
            are for convergence time. During this convergence time, all the epochs computed will not be taken into account for the summary and
            the Stanford-ESA computation will be skipped. This behaviour can be disabled with the parameter '--summary:waitfordaystart'.
          If backwards processing is active, epochs missing and data gaps will only be counted during the forward processing.
          If receiver position is not fixed or provided by a reference file, the percentile lines will not appear.
          If user provides a reference file for comparing the solution and if at a certain epoch the reference file position is not available,
            the epoch will be skipped from the summary.
          The last line of the summary contains all the values of the previous lines along with the station coordinates. The values between brackets
            correspond to the column number.
          The day printed in the last line of the summary corresponds to the day of the first epoch in the summary.
          If receiver position is not fixed, the station coordinates will be the solution from the last computed epoch.
          The last line is useful for plotting world maps with data from each station.
          Stanford-ESA messages will not appear if Stanford-ESA computation has not been enabled.
          HDOP, PDOP and GDOP threshold messages will not appear if HDOP, PDOP or GDOP thresholds have not been enabled respectively.
          The lines referring to a reference file will only appear if a user sets a reference file. If user sets the reference file just for comparing
            the solution, the line "Total epochs omitted in ..." will appear. Otherwise, if the reference file was set to be used as the a priori
            position for the modelling computation, the line "Total epochs skipped due to no position from reference file ..." will appear.

    PPP SUMMARY [PPP processing modes]
        PPP statiscal summary. It is printed at the end of the output file if summary is enabled.
        All time tags are in GPS time.

        NOTES:
          If observation file starts at 22 hours or later, gLAB will automatically assume that all the epochs until the start of the next day (midnight)
            are for convergence time. During this convergence time, all the epochs computed will not be taken into account for the summary.
            This behaviour can be disabled with the parameter '--summary:waitfordaystart'.
          If backwards processing is active, epochs missing and data gaps will only be counted during the forward processing.
          If receiver position is not fixed or provided by a reference file, the percentile lines will not appear.
          If user provides a reference file for comparing the solution and if at a certain epoch the reference file position is not available,
            the epoch will be skipped from the summary.
          The last line of the summary contains all the values of the previous lines along with the station coordinates. The values between brackets
            correspond to the column number.
          The day printed in the last line of the summary corresponds to the day of the first epoch in the summary.
          If receiver position is not fixed, the station coordinates will be the solution from the last computed epoch.
          The last line is useful for plotting world maps with data from each station.
          HDOP, PDOP and GDOP threshold messages will not appear if HDOP, PDOP or GDOP thresholds have not been enabled respectively.
          The lines referring to a reference file will only appear if a user sets a reference file. If user sets the reference file just for comparing
            the solution, the line "Total epochs omitted in ..." will appear. Otherwise, if the reference file was set to be used as the a priori
            position for the modelling computation, the line "Total epochs skipped due to no position from reference file ..." will appear.

    SBAS SUMMARY [SBAS processing mode]
        SBAS statiscal summary. It is printed at the end of the output file if summary is enabled.
        All time tags are in GPS time.

        NOTES:
          If observation file starts at 22 hours or later, gLAB will automatically assume that all the epochs until the start of the next day (midnight)
          	are for convergence time. During this convergence time, all the epochs computed will not be taken into account for the SBAS summary and
          	the Stanford-ESA computation will be skipped. This behaviour can be disabled with the parameter '--summary:waitfordaystart'.
          If receiver position is not fixed or provided by a reference file, the percentile lines will not appear.
          If user provides a reference file for comparing the solution and if at a certain epoch the reference file position is not available,
            the epoch will be skipped from the summary.
          The last line of the SBAS summary contains all the values of the previous lines along with the station coordinates. The values between brackets
            correspond to the column number.
          The last line is useful for plotting world maps with data from each station.
          The day printed in the last line of the summary corresponds to the day of the first epoch in the summary.
          If receiver position is not fixed, the station coordinates will be the solution from the last computed epoch.
          The fields at the end of the last line 'HWIR_ESA', 'VWIR_ESA', 'MIs_ESA', 'Hor_MIs_ESA' and 'Ver_MIs_ESA' correspond to the values computed in Stanford-ESA.
            These fields will appear even if Stanford-ESA has not been enabled, but with a value of 0 (so its column number is fixed).
          Stanford-ESA messages will not appear if Stanford-ESA computation has not been enabled.
          HDOP, PDOP and GDOP threshold messages will not appear if HDOP, PDOP or GDOP thresholds have not been enabled respectively.
          Number of epochs with NPA epoch message will not appear if mode switching has not been enabled.

          If user forced NPA processing through parameters, then all values in SBAS summary will be referred to NPA mode.
          The lines referring to a reference file will only appear if a user sets a reference file. If user sets the reference file just for comparing
            the solution, the line "Total epochs omitted in ..." will appear. Otherwise, if the reference file was set to be used as the a priori
            position for the modelling computation, the line "Total epochs skipped due to no position from reference file ..." will appear.

    DGNSS SUMMARY [DGNSS processing mode]
        DGNSS statiscal summary. It is printed at the end of the output file if summary is enabled.
        All time tags are in GPS time.

    SATDIFF [orbit and clock comparison]
        Satellite difference message for products comparison mode. This message shows the difference between
        both orbit and clocks for two different OC products fonts for a specific time. It is shown each time step.
        The SISRE fields are the Signal-in-Space Range Error, it is a measure of how the error impact a general
        receiver found in the Earth's surface. It is computed as:
            SISRE = sqrt((radDiff-clkDiff)^2 + 1/49*(ctDiff^2 + atDiff^2))
        Being:
            radDiff, the difference of satellite positions in the radial component
            clkDiff, the difference of satellite clock offsets
            ctDiff, the difference of satellite positions in the cross-track component
            atDiff, the difference of satellite positions in the along-track component
        Messages will be sorted by constellation and PRN, with this constellation order: GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, GEO, BeiDou, QZSS, IRNSS.
