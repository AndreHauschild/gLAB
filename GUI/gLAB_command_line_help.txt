    -input:sp3 <file> [<file>]  Sets the input SP3 orbits and clocks file.
                                  If two SP3 files are provided and no observation file is given, gLAB will enter in orbit comparison mode

    -input:orb <file> [<file>]  Sets the input SP3 orbits (only reads the satellite coordinates, but not the clocks)
                                  If two SP3 files are provided and no observation file is given, gLAB will enter in orbit comparison mode

    -input:clk <file>       Sets the input clock file. The number of clock files must match the number of
                                  SP3 files provided with option '-input:orb'

    -input:con <file>       Sets the input constellation status file (default GPSConstellationStatus.txt)

    -input:ant <file>       Sets the input ANTEX satellite/receiver antenna data file

    -input:antrec <file> [<file>]   Sets the input ANTEX receiver antenna data file. If this file contains data for
                               satellites, this data will be skipped. Up to two receiver ANTEX files may be provided.
                               If a receiver read with this ANTEX had been also read with the ANTEX provided with
                               parameter '-input:ant', the data will be overwritten with the last data read.
                               Up to two receiver ANTEX files may be provided

    -input:antsatblock <file>   Sets the input ANTEX file for reading the satellites block type (e.g. GPS BLOCK II-A, II-R, etc.)
                                With the satellite block type, gLAB can know which measurements has available each
                                 satellite (e.g. which GPS satellites have  or do not have L5 frequency), and thus auto remove
                                 all unavailable measurements of the satellite from the priority list.
                                The typical use case for this option is when the user sets, for instance, in the filter, the
                                 option '-filter:select G0-PC15 G0-PC12 G0-LC15 G0-LC12', which is a typical PPP with three
                                 frequencies. Without an ANTEX file (provided with parameter '-input:ant' or '-input:antsatblock'
                                 all GPS satellites with no L5 measurements would be discarded, as it will be detected that there
                                 are measurements missing (L5 ones) for cycle-slip and the filter. With the ANTEX file, all L5
                                 measurements will be removed (in cycle-slips and filter) in all satellites without L5, and therefore
                                 gLAB will use L1,L2,L5 measurements in satellites with L5 and only L1,L2 in satellites without L5.
                                If '-input:ant' parameter is provided, there is no need to provide this parameter (as satellite blocks
                                 can be read from '-input:ant' ANTEX file), unless the user wants to use an ANTEX file different from the
                                one provided in '-input:ant' parameter.

    -input:klb <file>       Sets the input RINEX navigation file for Klobuchar corrections, if this parameter
                             is avoided, it is used the -input:nav file

    -input:bds <file>       Sets the input RINEX navigation file for BeiDou corrections, if this parameter
                             is avoided, it is used the -input:nav file

    -input:inx  <file>      Sets the input IONEX file for ionospheric corrections

    -input:fppp <file>      Sets the input FPPP file for ionospheric corrections

    -input:neq  <file>      Sets the input RINEX navigation file for NeQuick corrections, if this parameter
                             is avoided, it is used the -input:nav file

    -input:sbasiono <file>  Sets the input RINEX-B or EMS SBAS file for ionospheric corrections

    -input:dcb <file> [...] Sets the input DCB source from a .DCB file, a RINEX navigation file, a IONEX file or a FPPP file.
                             If more than one file is given for the same model, the last one will be used 

    -input:rec <file>       Sets the input GPS receiver types file (default GPS_Receiver_Types) for DCB usage

    -input:snx <file>       Sets the input SINEX file for receiver position

    -input:sbas1f <file>    Sets the SBAS data file (RINEX-B v2.11 or EMS). Activates SBAS 1F processing mode

    -input:sbasdfmc <file>  Sets the SBAS data file (RINEX-B v2.11 or EMS). Activates SBAS DFMC processing mode

    -input:dgnss <file>     Sets the input RINEX observation file of the Reference Station for DGNSS

    -input:rtcm <file>      Sets the input RTCM binary file, gLAB will automatically detect the RTCM version

    -input:rtcm2 <file>     Sets the input RTCM v2.x binary file

    -input:rtcm3 <file>     Sets the input RTCM v3.x binary file

    -input:rtcm:initdate <date>     Sets the date when the record of the binary file RTCM began (YYYYMMDD), required only
                                      when processing or converting RTCM v2.x and RTCM v3.x

    -input:rtcm:inithour <hour>     Sets the hour in GPST, when the record of the binary file RTCM began (HH 24-hour format),
                                      required when processing or converting RTCM v2.x

    -input:usererror <file> Sets the data file for adding user defined error signal to raw measurements (execute 'gLAB -usererrorfile' for details)

    -input:refpos    <file> Sets the reference position file. It can be a SP3 or a columnar text file (execute 'gLAB -referencefile' for details)
                             This option will set receiver positioning mode to 'calculate' if non set. See '-pre:setrecpos' option below for details

    The use of '-input:nav' file will preconfigure the parameters to work in the Standard Point Positioning (SPP).

    The use of '-input:sp3'/'-input:orb'/'-input:clk' will preconfigure the parameters to work in the Precise Point
      Positioning (PPP) approach. All the values can be overridden by specifying the parameters. See below for more details
      on which are the defaults for each mode.

    The use of '-input:sbas1f' will preconfigure the parameters to work in SBAS 1 Frequency mode.

    The use of '-input:sbasdfmc' will preconfigure the parameters to work in SBAS DFMC mode.

    The use of any '-input:rtcm' without a '-input:obs' will result into converting the input RTCM to its corresponding output.

                            [+-]     =  Optional symbols for selecting (with a plus '+') or unselecting (with a minus '-')
                                         If no symbol is provided, the default behaviour is to unselect satellites
                            g        = Character determining GNSS constellation (G->GPS). If g=0, apply it to all constellations

                            120 <= # <= 210 => Use the GEO with the given PRN

    -pre:minsnr             Set a minimum SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) value for using a satellite.
                            The SNR is read from the observation file. [default on in SBAS and DGNSS]
                            If no SNR is present in the observation file, no deselection is done. The default threshold is 33 dBHz

    -pre:minsnrsel g[g]#[-#][.#[-#]] <val> [#[.#.#]][-<meas1>[-<meas2>]] [g[g]#[-#][.#[-#]] <val> [#[.#.#]][-<meas1>[-<meas2>]]] [...]
                               Set a minimum SNR threshold for a given satellite. If this option is given, SNR deselection will be activated
                            g     = Character determining GNSS constellation (G->GPS). If g=0, apply it to all constellations
                            [g]   = More than one character for GNSS constellation may be provided, so multiple GNSS can be selected at once

                            <val> = Value for SNR threshold in dBHz. This value is compared to the SNR obtained from the RINEX file in all code,
                                     carrier phase and Doppler measurements. If no SNR value is present in the RINEX file, this value will be omitted.
                            [#[.#.#]][-<meas1>[-<meas2>]] = Optionally, the user can set a list of frequencies or measurements (or both)
                                     where to apply this threshold. If a frequency is given, all measurements from that frequency will have
                                     the threshold applied. If no frequency or measurement is given, it will be applied to all measurements.
                                     Any number of frequencies or measurements can be given, as long as frequencies are grouped and separated
                                     by dots, and separated from measurements with a dash ('-'). Each measurement given has to be separated
                                     with a dash ('-'). The list of frequencies may be given in any position, not necessarily before the
                                     measurements or after the measurements.
                                     If a measurement is provided (code, carrier phase or Doppler), the threshold will be applied to code,
                                     carrier phase and Doppler measurements of the same type (for instance C1C, L1C and D1C), as in the RINEX
                                     observation file these measurements share the SNR value.
                            Sample: '-pre:minsnrsel G0 33' Set a threshold of 33 dbHz to all GPS measurements.

    -pre:maxsnr             Set a maximum SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) value for using a satellite. Discarding satellites with high SNR can be
                            useful for filtering satellites under spoofing. The SNR is read from the observation file. [default off]
                            If no SNR is present in the observation file, no deselection is done. The default threshold is 54 dBHz

                             MW combination is a mixed combination between carrier phase and pseudoranges.
                             This combination is free of ionosphere and geometry, thence constant, but
                             has a high noise (due to the pseudorange measurements used). If this noise is
                             low enough, it is straightforward to detect cycle-slips, but in noisy environments
                             MW is not able to detect cycle-slips. The algorithm using MW computes the mean and
                             the standard deviation of the last epochs in order to obtain an estimated value
                             and the noise level of the combination. The estimated value is compared against the
                             measured value, and the noise level is used for the threshold of this difference.
                             Difference must be lower than standard deviation multiplied by a number (k-factor).
                             This threshold has minimum (min) and maximum (max) saturation values.

                             for several epochs. This cycle-slip detection method is very useful for single-frequency receivers, as it only
                             requires measurements from one frequency. As a counterpart, the ionospheric term is different for code and phase,
                             thence, this combination will tend to diverge. It becomes necessary to set a smoothing window
                             to limit this divergence (-pre:cs:sf:timewindow). This makes that this method becomes a bit limited
                             with data rates too low. Ideally this method should be used with rates of 1 Hz.

                             The list of frequencies is used for selecting a measurement for navigation when user has not set any.
                             For instance, in SPP, gLAB adds a measurement (using the measurement priority order defined in option
                               '-pre:measorder') with the frequency given by this list. gLAB will try to use the first frequency in
                               the list. If the frequency does not exist, or it is set as unavailable by the user or it is not
                               available in the RINEX observation file, it will be skipped and continue with the next frequency in the list.
                             For PPP, gLAB follows the same procedure, but selecting two frequencies for the ionosphere-free combination.
                             This frequency list order is also used when filling dual/triple frequency combinations for MW, LI and IGF

                             The criteria for the auto selection of measurement is to use the first measurement with the given attribute
                             in the list that is available in the observation file. This selection is done independently for pseudorange and
                             carrier phase, therefore, the pair of measurements (pseudoranges and carrier phase) used may be from different
                             types (for instance, it could select C1W and L1C). To force using only pair of measurements from the same attribute,
                             set option '-pre:meassel:pairedmeas'
                               Sample: '-pre:measorder G0-C15-PWCX'
                                       '-pre:measorder -G0-C15-P'

    -pre:meassel:pairedmeas   When gLAB automatically selects the measurements to be used, force to use only paired measurements for

                               For instance, if rover RINEX observation file version 3.X has measurements C1C, L1C and C1W, C1W pseudorange measurement
                               will not be used as L1W carrier phase measurement is not available (it usually occurs with Septentrio receivers).
                               For RINEX v2, this option has no effect, as C1/P1/L1 and C2/P2/L2 are never paired (there are two codes but only one phase).
                               This option also has no effect for Doppler measurements.

                              Enabling this option will noticeably increase the computation time (especially if there are many GEOs
                              in the SBAS data file), as gLAB needs to compute the SBAS modelling with each GEO, and then select the best one.
                              Read section "Selection of best GEO:" below for details on the criteria of how the best GEO is selected.

    -model:maintaingeo      If GEO switch for SBAS is enabled, maintain current GEO while possible independently if it is the GEO

                            SBAS region, making all satellites unavailable due to the lack of ionosphere. This option only has effect if SBAS

                              This timer is set to ensure that we have received enough corrections from the GEO we want to switch to.
                              If this timer is set too low (few seconds), it may happen that we switch to a GEO with not enough data (due to
                              we are in initialization or the GEO has received an alarm message
                              gLAB will not switch to any GEO before this time, except for when an alarm message is received and there is no other GEO available

                                   <val>    = Ccorr value (in metres)

    -model:sbasdfmc:rcorr       g[g]-<val> Set the value (in metres/second) of Rcorr (per constellation) parameter in SBAS DFMC MT 37 [default read from MT37]

    -model:sbasdfmc:dfreilist <val0>,<val1>,...,<val14>
                                 Set the value (in metres) for all possible DFREI values in a comma separated list.
                                 The list must contain 15 values in DFREI ascending order, from DFREI=0 to DFREI=14
                              Example: 0.125,0.25,0.375,0.5,0.625,0.75,1,1.25,1.5,1.75,2,2.5,3,4,10

    -model:sbasdfmc:deltadfre      <val>   Set the value (unitless) of Delta DFRE instead of computing it from MT 32 or MT39/40 [default compute from MT32 or MT39/40]

    -model:sbasdfmc:sigmauire      <val>   Set the value (in metres) of UIRE sigma instead of using MOPS formula [default use MOPS formula]

    -model:sbasdfmc:sigmatropo     <val>   Set the value (in metres) of troposphere sigma instead of using MOPS formula [default use MOPS formula]

    -model:sbasdfmc:sigmpathfactor <val>   Set the value (adimensional) for the factor to convert the receiver sigma multipath from single frequency to dual frequency [default 2.59]
                                            This factor is to account for the noise increase in the ionosphere-free combination, as the receiver sigma multipath is computed
                                            the one for SBAS 1 frequency (as described in parameter '-model:sigmpath').

    -model:sbasdfmc:anymeas  Allow to use any measurement for processing in SBAS DFMC mode in the default measurements are not available [default off]
                             In SBAS DFMC, measurements for navigation are fixed to GPS C1C-L1C, C5Q-L5Q and Galileo C1C-L1C, C5Q-L5Q. If these measurements
                              are not available, gLAB by default will refuse to process in SBAS DFMC. If this option is enabled, gLAB will allow to use any
                              measurement from the same frequency as substitute for the default ones. For instance, some receivers only provide the
                              combined L5 measurements (C5X-L5X) for both GPS and Galileo, so it is necessary to enable this option to process data with them
                              If this option is enabled and measurements different from the defaults are used, a bias will appear between the estimated
                              SBAS DFMC corrections and the used measurments, degrading the navigation solution.

    -model:sbasdfmc:austestbed  Configure gLAB to process Australian SBAS DFMC test bed messages, which uses messages format from SBAS DFMC MOPS 0.3.8 (March 2017) and
                                sends MT0 to send MT34, MT35 and MT36. This parameter is a shortcut for providing parameters '-model:sbasdfmc:mt37v04',
                                '-model:sbasdfmc:mt3940v04', '-model:sbasdfmc:mt42v07', '-model:sbasdfmc:mt47v04', '-model:usealarmmsgcorr' and
                                '--model:dcb:df:gps'

    -model:dgnss:sigmainflation   The sigma is inflated during the smoother convergence (see DGNSS notes at the end) [default on]

    --model:dgnss:sigmainflation  Do not use the sigma inflation during the smoother convergence

    -model:dgnss:maxage <val>     Set the maximum age value (in seconds) to stop applying DGNSS corrections [default 31]

    -model:dgnss:maxcorrval <val> Set the maximum value for a DGNSS correction to be considered valid (in metres) [default 500]

    -model:dgnss:measprc [+-]g[g]#[-#][.#[-#]]-<PRCmeas>-[<meas1>-<meas2>[-<meas3>-<meas4>]] [...]
                            Set the measurements to use for computing the corrections in the reference station in DGNSS mode
                            Measurements are set in the same way as in option '-filter:select'

    -model:dgnss:measprclist [+-]g[g]#[-#][.#[-#]]-<PRCmeas>-[<meas1>-<meas2>[-<meas3>-<meas4>]],...]
                                Same as '-model:dgnss:measprclist', but each entry is separated by commas (',') instead of blank spaces

     NOTE: When setting any fast, slow, ionosphere correction or their sigmas to 0, gLAB will still check all the conditions
             for the current mode. For example, if gLAB is in PA mode and the '-model:nofastcor' parameter is set, then it
             will search for a fast correction, and if it is available, it will set the value to 0 instead of the one
             given in the SBAS message. If there is no SBAS fast correction available, the satellite will not be used.

     NOTE: The SBAS timeouts given by the user will override the defaults stated in MOPS-D.

  FILTERING OPTIONS

    -filter:stepdetector    Check for jumps in measurements using the prefits residuals (only for C1C measurement) [default off]
                             Use '--filter:stepdetector' to disable it

    -filter:prefitoutliers:median  <val> Check for outliers in the prefits residuals using the median, with <val> (in metres) as the threshold [default off]
                             Use '--filter:prefitoutliers:median' or '-filter:prefitoutliers:median 0' to disable it. See notes on prefit outlier detectors below

    -filter:prefitoutliers:abs  <val> Check for outliers in the prefits residuals comparing absolute values, with  <val> (in metres) as the threshold [default off]
                             Use '--filter:prefitoutliers:abs' or '-filter:prefitoutliers:abs 0' to disable it. See notes on prefit outlier detectors below

    -filter:noambiguities    Assume carrier phase measurements are absolute measurements [default off]
                              If this option is enabled, gLAB will assume that carrier phase measurements are absolute measurements (i.e. the
                               ambiguity has been already been added, either by modifying the RINEX observation file or by adding it as a user defined
                               error with option '-input:usererror'.
                               When this option is enabled, code jumps detection and carrier phase alignment will be switched off.
                               Furthermore, carrier phase will be used to computed signal flight time and for detection outliers in the prefit outlier detectors.
                               In order to use this option correctly, check in the FAQ the question 'CAN gLAB PROCESS CARRIER PHASE MEASUREMENTS AS ABSOLUTE MEASUREMENTS?'

                                  the default combinations to use (i.e. the user does not provide any measurement for the filter
                                  with parameter '-filter:select'). This option only applies for SPP and PPP modes.
                            <combtype> = auto           gLAB decides which combinations to use (single frequency for SPP, dual frequency in PPP) [default]

    -filter:select [+-]g[g]#[-#][.#[-#]]-<filtermeas>-[<meas1>-<meas2>[-<meas3>-<meas4>]] [...]
                                Set the measurements or combinations to be used in the filter.
                                Each entry must be separated by a blank space (' ')
                            [+-]   Optional symbols for selecting (with a plus '+') or unselecting (with a minus '-')
                                    If no symbol is provided, the default behaviour is to select measurements
                            g        = Character determining GNSS constellation (G->GPS). If g=0, apply it to all constellations
                            [g]      = More than one character for GNSS constellation may be provided, so multiple GNSS can be selected at once

                                            with a dot ('.')
                            <filtermeas>   Set the measurement or combination to be used in the filter
                                 For single measurement and user selected measurement, the measurement name must be provided (in RINEX 2 or 3 format).
                                 For single measurement and the measurement to be selected by gLAB: 
                                        Set value 'Pseudorange' or 'Code' (case insensitive), a hyphen ('-') and the frequency number to use,
                                     OR set value 'Phase' or 'Carrierphase' (case insensitive), a hyphen ('-') and the frequency number to use.
                                 For dual/triple/quadruple combinations, the combination name with its frequencies must be given.
                            [<meas1>-<meas2>[-<meas3>-<meas4>]] If measurement is a combination, optionally set the measurements to use.
                                        For dual frequency combinations, two measurements are needed. For triple or quadruple frequency
                                        combinations, four measurements are needed.
                                        If measurements are not set, they will be automatically selected using the measurement list (see
                                        parameter '-pre:measorderlist'). 
                                        In the case of dual, triple or quadruple measurements, if user does not set the measurements, the type
                                        of measurements (pseudorange or carrier phase) to use is undefined. The user can set by appending
                                        '-code' or '-pseudorange' (for pseudorange) or '-phase' or '-carrierphase' (for carrier phase). For
                                        setting pseudorange and carrierphase at once (in two different measurements), use the word '-codephase'
                                        or '-phasecode'. All arguments are case insensitive. If not set, gLAB will assume that the type to be used
                                        is a carrier phase.
                            [...]  User can set multiple filter measurements
                               Sample: '-filter:select G0-L1P ER0-auto'

            NOTES:
             - To set a graphic combination, use the letter 'G' plus the frequency. To set also the measurements, add them after the frequency between dashes.
                 Example: '-filter:select G0-G1 G0-E1-C1C-L1C E0-G5'

             - To set a ionospheric-free combination, use the letters 'IF' plus the frequencies and type or the measurements.
                 Example: '-filter:select G0-IF12-code E0-IF15-phase R0-IF12-codephase C0-IF15-C1C-C5Q C0-IF15-L1C-L5Q'
                Note that for ionospheric-free combination, letters 'PC' and 'LC' can also be used (the former for code and the latter for carrier phase)
                 Example: '-filter:select G0-PC12 E0-LC15 R0-PC12 R0-LC12 C0-PC15-C1C-C5Q C0-LC15-L1C-L5Q'

             - For triple/quadruple frequency combinations, the first two frequencies are used for building one dual frequency combination,
                and next two frequencies are used for building the second dual frequency combination.

             - For dual/triple/quadruple frequency combinations, gLAB will internally reorder the frequency number in order to match its
                internal order for the combination (in the output messages it will be printed with its internal order). In quadruple
                combinations, the internal frequency reordering does respect the pair of frequencies used for making the combinations.

             - In gLAB versions 5 and below, this parameter had the following format:
                          -filter:select <num> <meas1> <meas2> ...
                     This old format is deprecated, but it is still supported for compatibility with previous versions

                                   'j', the index for the second, 'k' for the index third and 'l' the index for the fourth):
                               <val> = SNRi    For a combination with 2 frequencies (ij) or 4 frequencies (ijkl), use SNR from measurement of frequency i
                               <val> = SNRj    For a combination with 2 frequencies (ij) or 4 frequencies (ijkl), use SNR from measurement of frequency j
                               <val> = SNRk    For a combination with 4 frequencies (ijkl), use SNR from measurement of frequency k
                               <val> = SNRl    For a combination with 4 frequencies (ijkl), use SNR from measurement of frequency l
                               <val> = MaxSNR  Use the highest SNR of the measurements used in the combination
                               <val> = MinSNR  Use the lowest SNR of the measurements used in the combination
                               <val> = MeanSNR Use the mean SNR value of the two measurements used in the combination [default]
                               0 <= <val> <= 1 If <val> is a number between [0,1], combine the SNR with the following formula:
                                                 SNR = SNRi*<val> + SNRj*(1-<val>)

                                           value of this parameter. The SNR will be combined with the following formula:
                                                 SNR = SNRi*<val1> + SNRj*<val2> + SNRk*<val3> + SNRl*<val4>

                                             four values must be equal to one (<val1> + <val2> + <val3> + <val4> = 1)
                               [...]  User can set multiple times a filter measurement and <val> value
                            Sample: '-filter:snrweight:comb G0-LC12 SNRi'  In combination LC12 (carrier phase iono free combination) in all GPS satellites, the SNR

                NOTES: - For a dual frequency combination with frequencies 'i' and 'j', 'i' is always the smallest frequency number and 'j' the highest,
                           except for frequency '0', which will be always the highest (it it treated as frequency number '10').
                           For example, for combination PC12, i=1 and j=2. For combination LC10, i=1,j=0
                       - For a triple or quadruple frequency combination, for instance, combination SIF1234, ijkl values would correspond to

                                  This parameter allows to skip computation of combinations with many satellites, which will not have
                                  problems if all their subsets behave correctly. This filter may be necessary if too many satellites
                                  are in view, as the number of combinations will increase exponentially. Minimum value for parameter is 4.

    -onlyconvert            Convert EMS or RINEX-B file to RINEX-B, EMS or Pegasus and exit without processing any GNSS data [default off]

    Incorrect messages from RINEX-B or EMS files are messages which grant any of these conditions:
      CRC mismatch, invalid header, unknown message type, invalid time of applicability (time is over 86400 seconds)

    In case of not setting '-output:rinex', '-output:corrections' and/or '-output:antenna' gLAB will set automatically a name for the output file[s].
      These previous options are effective only if an RTCM file is converted. Therefore, there will be no RTCM converted files if the input RTCM file is processed

    NOTE: A KML with a 1 second rate data and 1 second timestamp rate may be too big for Google Earth

  SUMMARY OPTIONS

      When processing in SPP/PPP/SBAS/DGNSS modes, if summary is enabled a statistical summary will be printed
        at the end of the output file. If receiver position is not fixed, error percentiles messages will not be shown
        The options for generating this summary are:

    -summary:percentile  <val>  Sets the value for computing the error percentile [default 95]

    -summary:waitfordaystart    If the observation file starts at 22 hours or later, gLAB will assume that from the first epoch
                                     until epoch 23 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds are given just to fill the messages buffer and wait for
                                     the smoothing and filter to converge, and the following epochs from the next day are the ones of interest.
                                     During this convergence period, Stanford-ESA values will not be computed and they will not be taken into
                                     account for the summary. This option is useful to avoid high error epoch in the summary
                                     during the convergence time. [default on]
                                    This option can be disabled with '--summary:waitfordaystart'
                                    This option will have no effect if '-summary:starttime' is set

    -summary:starttime <date>  Set the first epoch (in GPS time) to be used in the summary. See parameter '-pre:starttime' for details on date format

    -summary:stationnetworkname <name> Sets the station network name to be printed in the last line of summary. This is useful for doing
                                         stations maps with each station network having different marker type, colour or size
                                         with the graphical tool (after merging the last line of the summary of several processed
                                         stations in a single file) [default 'Other']

      NOTE: The last line of the summary contains all the values of the previous lines along with the station coordinates.
            	This line is useful for plotting world maps with data from each station.

      NOTE: An example of a summary can be seen executing gLAB with '-messages' parameter

                               Set a square area where SBAS availability and SBAS iono availability will be set to 0 (the area is skipped during computation)
                                 This is useful when processing large areas (e.g. areas with multiple SBAS and want to exclude the sea between them)
                                 The user can set any number of exclusion area by providing this parameter as many times as necessary
                                 The area must be given with these four values (in this order): minimum longitude, maximum longitude,
                                 minimum latitude, maximum latitude. The four values must be in degrees, with the longitude between -180

                                     Use '--sbasplots:mingeoelev' to disable it.

    -sbasplots:usegeosat     Use GEO SBAS satellites for ranging when computing Availability maps [default off]

   If both inclusion and exclusion areas are provided, then an area which is processed must be inside of any inclusion area and outside of any exclusion area.
   The default region defined in gLAB corresponds to EGNOS coverage area.
   The available output messages in this mode are INFO [default on], SBASIONO [default off] and SBASUNSEL [default off]
   Most of the options applied for normal SBAS processing can also be applied for this mode, except for those which apply to measurement corrections (due to
     there are none in this mode) and the option to use Klobuchar while solution converges ('-model:initcoordNPA') as we consider we are always in strict PA mode.

   An example of the generated figures with graph program is in the SBAS manual (file gLAB_SBAS_SUM.pdf)

    -coordconv:cartesian <x> <y> <z>
               X, Y and Z coordinates unit is metres.

    -coordconv:geodetic <lon> <lat> <height>

  WORK MODES

    gLAB can work in nine different modes:
        - Positioning Mode: 'Standard' mode, where all the processing is done, and a solution for a
                       receiver is provided as OUTPUT messages. The minimum parameters required for this
                       mode are an input observation file ('-input:obs') and orbit and clock products
                       ('-input:nav', '-input:sp3' or '-input:orb'/'-input:clk'). Using precise products
                       will also require the use of an ANTEX file ('-input:ant'). For SBAS processing, an
                       additional input SBAS file ('-input:sbas1f') is needed. For DGNSS processing, an
                       additional input file ('-input:dgnss' or '-input:rtcm') is needed

        - Show Input Mode: This mode only reads an input RINEX observation file and print its measurements.
                       The parameter required for this mode is '-input:obs', and specifically, no orbit and
                       clock products should be provided (if provided, gLAB will switch to Positioning Mode)

        - Product Comparison Mode: This mode reads and compares two different sources of orbit and clock products.
                       In order to use this mode, '-input:obs' must be avoided, and two different orbit and clock
                       products should be provided. This mode outputs the SATDIFF, SATSTAT and STASTATTOT messages

        - Show Product Mode: This mode reads a single source of orbit and clock products.
                       In order to use this mode, '-input:obs' must be avoided, and a single orbit and clock
                       product should be provided. This mode output SAT messages

        - Convert mode: Only for SBAS. If the parameter '-onlyconvert' is given, gLAB will just generate a RINEX-B 2.11 or EMS
                       or Pegasus files (depending on the parameters) and it will not process any GNSS data.
                       The minimum parameters for this mode are an SBAS file ('-input:sbas1f'), the '-onlyconvert' parameter
                       and an output file format ('-output:rinexb', '-output:ems', '-output:pegasus')

        - SBAS Plots Mode: This mode is activated when only a navigation file and a SBAS file are given. In this mode,
                       three plots are computed: SBAS Availability, SBAS Continuity Risk and SBAS Ionosphere Corrections Availability.
                       The three plots are computed in PA mode in the delimited (squared) region and resolution during one day (the Availability and
                       Continuity Risk are computed at a one second rate, while the Ionosphere Corrections Availability is computed at a 300 seconds rate by default).
                       For the three plots the values are computed for a Fault-Free receiver (no data gaps, no cycle-slips).
                       For SBAS Availability plots, an epoch at a given latitude and longitude and height (by default is the WGS84 geoid level -0 metres-)
                         is considered to be available when both the Horizontal and Vertical Protection Levels are below their respective alarm limits.
                       For SBAS Continuity Risk plot, it is computed the probability of having a discontinuity (i.e. no SBAS PA solution) during the
                         next 15 seconds (i.e. using a sliding window of 15 seconds) in aviation mode. In maritime processing, it is followed the
                         IMO (International Maritime Organization) resolution A.1046 (27), which states that there will be only one discontinuity
                         every 15 minutes, so each discontinuity will affect the previous 15 minutes (even if two consecutive discontinuity events
                         occur in less than 15 minutes). See notes for SBAS maritime below.
                       For SBAS Ionosphere Corrections Availability plot, each coordinate in the map is considered as a pierce point at 350 km height,
                         and it is considered as available when a SBAS ionosphere can be computed at the given pierce point.
                       The minimum parameters to activate this mode are the input navigation file ('-input:nav') and the input SBAS message file ('-input:sbas1f').
                       The output files have to be processed with graph program (with '--sbas' parameter) in order to generate the plots.
                       The available output messages in this mode are INFO [default on], SBASIONO [default off] and SBASUNSEL [default off].
                       NOTE: With the default configuration, the computation time is around 2 hours. Increasing resolution or map size
                              will significantly increase computation time.

        - Add User Error to RINEX: This mode reads a RINEX observation file, a user added error file and creates a new RINEX observation file
                       with the same header, version and number of measurements, but the measurements have the user error added into them.
                       This mode is enabled by providing only and observation file and a user added error file with the parameters
                       '-input:obs' and '-input:usererror'
                       Optionally, a GLONASS navigation file may be provided (with parameter '-input:navglo') for reading frequency offsets.

        - Date Conversion: When '-dateconv:calendar' or '-dateconv:doy' or '-dateconv:gpsweek' or '-dateconv:mjdn' are provided, gLAB will read the date
                       from user input and convert it to all other date formats, print them in screen and exit.

        - Coordinate Conversion: When '-coordconv:cartesian' or '-coordconv:geodetic' or '-coordconv:spherical' are provided, gLAB will read the coordinates
                       from user input and convert it to all other coordinate systems, print them in screen and exit.

  gLAB PROCESSING DIAGRAM

     Below is provided a diagram of gLAB internal processing workflow (in Positioning Mode), along with important notes in each step:

            +-------------------------+
            | 1      Read input       |  Measurement priority list (shared by filter and cycle-slip detectors) is updated or replaced according to user input.

            |          SP3/CLK        |  If navigation file is concatenated, gLAB reads until a header is found. The following set of data will be read when the
            |          ANTEX          |    day of the observation file changes. Up to two navigation days of data (two data sets read) are held in memory.
            |           DCB           |  If SP3 or CLK files are concatenated, up to three days will be read at once (so it has data in memory for the previous,
            |        Navigation       |    current and next days) in order to avoid orbit interpolation errors at the beginning and at the end of the day.

       |    |       configuration     |  By default, gLAB will add to each enabled cycle-slip detectors all frequencies with carrier phase measurements set in

  NOTES FOR PEGASUS OUTPUT FORMAT

     Pegasus is a GNSS data processing tool from Eurocontrol. Pegasus does not read the RINEX-B or EMS SBAS files, it converts them to columnar text
       files and later processes with these text files. Each text file contains one message type -except for fast correction messages, which are all
       grouped in the same file; and the GEO navigation data, which is RINEX 2 format.
       Each columnar text file has a header line with the name of each value, and the values are printed in decimal format.
       A full explanation of the Pegasus format can be found in appendixes I.5-I.16 in their ICD at http://www.icao.int/Meetings/AMC/MA/2004/GNSS/icd.pdf

  NOTES FOR PREPROCESSING

     Pseudorange Jumps:
       Some receivers, after updating the clock, they adjust the code but not the carrier phase measurement, producing a jump in the code
         but not in the carrier phase. Therefore, code and carrier phase are not consistent (the difference between code and
         carrier phase is not continuous). If the carrier phase is not adjusted, it will be detected as a cycle-slip.

  NOTES FOR SBAS PROCESSING

    When processing with SBAS corrections, gLAB will use MOPS-D standard values and configuration by default.
    Most of these parameters and configuration can be modified by the user, regardless if these parameters are MOPS compliant or not.
    The specific SBAS parameters that can be modified by the user are:
        Smoothing:       Can be disabled or changed the number of epochs [default 100 epochs]
        Steady-state:    Can be disabled or changed the number of epochs [default 360 epochs]
        Ionosphere:      Any ionosphere model available in gLAB (e.g. IONEX) can be applied instead of the SBAS ionosphere model.
        Time outs:       Time outs for all corrections can be user defined
        Mode switch:     Switching from PA to NPA can be enabled or disabled [default disabled]
        GEO switch:      GEO switching can be enabled or disabled [default disabled]. Furthermore, after a GEO switch,
                         the user can decide if to stay in the new GEO or try to fall-back to the initial GEO when possible.
        Decimation:      gLAB can process at any data rate. In order to keep integrity of results with 1Hz SBAS data rate,
                            messages will be read every second, and special events will be handled every second.
                            The special events are: receive an alarm message or an UDREI>=14, miss 4 consecutive messages
                            or receive 4 consecutive messages with wrong CRC. Decimation is useful for studying slow
                            varying corrections, such as long term corrections or ionosphere.
        Navigation:      Both kinematic and static navigation mode can be selected. Default is kinematic.

    Mode and GEO switch notes:
      If both mode and GEO switch are enabled, GEO switch is tried first always, as switching GEO keeps PA mode.
      If option '-model:geofallback' is enabled, gLAB will try to switch to the first GEO used in processing after
        the time between switches (defined by parameter '-model:switchtime') after a GEO switch occurs.
      If option '-model:maintaingeo' is enabled gLAB will maintain the current GEO (independently if it was selected
        by the user or by a GEO switch) during all the processing while it can provide a PA solution.
      If both options '-model:maintaingeo' and '-model:geofallback' are enabled, '-model:geofallback' option behaviour will prevail.
      If both options '-model:maintaingeo' and '-model:geofallback' are disabled, after a GEO switch, gLAB will try to switch
        to the previous GEO independently if it was the first one used or not. If there are only two GEOs available (and the use of mixed GEO
        data is disabled), this behaviour is equivalent as in the '-model:geofallback' option, due to the previous GEO will be always the first GEO used.

    Selection of best GEO:
      When option '-model:selectbestgeo' is enabled, gLAB will compute in each epoch the full SBAS model and the protection levels with
        all the GEOs available, and then select the best GEO according to the following criteria:
           1 - Select the GEOs which have PA solution with protection levels under the alarm limits, and from these ones, select
                 the GEO whose sum of the horizontal and vertical protection levels is smaller.

           2 - If no GEOs had PA solution with protection levels under the alarm limits, select the GEOs with PA solution
                 and then select the GEO whose sum of the horizontal and vertical protection levels is smaller.

           3 - If no GEOs had PA solution, select the GEOs with NPA solution and then select the GEO whose sum of the
                 horizontal and vertical protection levels is smaller.

      This option will noticeably increase computation load, especially if there are many GEOs in the SBAS data file.
      If INFO messages are enabled (option '-print:info'), an INFO message with the epoch, GEO PRN and its protection levels will
        be printed for each iteration that provided a solution. The unselected iteration will have a '(Not selected)' text to indicate
        that it was not selected. The selected iteration will be printed last, with the text '(Selected)'.
      If option '-print:sbasunused' is enabled, the 'MODEL', 'SBASCORR', 'SBASVAR', 'SBASUNSEL' and 'SATSEL' messages for each discarded
        iteration will be printed. All messages from discarded iterations will have an '*' next to message name to indicate it was discarded.
        The iterations without solution will be printed first, and the last ones printed will be the iterations discarded but had solution.
      If selection of best GEO is set, the options '-model:geoswitch' will be automatically set. Moreover, option '-model:switchtime'
        must be set to 0 (if not set, it will be automatically set to 0), as in an epoch multiple GEO changes will be done, and also
         option '' must be disabled.

    SBAS Maritime mode:
      Maritime mode is a special configuration for SBAS. In this configuration, message type 10 (degradation parameters), type 27 (service message)
        and type 28 (clock ephemeris covariance matrix) are not used. Therefore, the sigma of fast and long term corrections is computed with the
        following formula:

                      Sigmaflt = SigmaUDRE + 8 (all units are in metres)

      Alarm limits in maritime mode are not used (in gLAB alarm limits cannot be disabled, so they are set to 100Km), and a filter for
        HDOP (Horizontal Dilution of Precision) and PDOP (Position Dilution of Precision). A valid epoch must have a HDOP<4 or a PDOP<6 (it only
        needs to fulfil one of these two conditions).
      Furthermore, for maritime mode, another mode for computing the continuity risk is used. Instead of a sliding windows of 15 seconds, it is used
        a fixed window of 15 minutes (900 seconds). That is, every time a discontinuity event occurs, it will affect the previous 15 minutes, independently
        if there had been a discontinuity within the previous 15 minutes (where as in aviation mode, each discontinuity only affects
        the last seconds until the previous discontinuity -up to the window size-). This is an optimistic computation of the continuity risk, but
        maritime mode has more relaxed requirements, as seen above. If desired, the user can change the size of the 15 minutes window to any value.
        The disadvantages of this mode of continuity risk computation are that if several discontinuities occur in a time span smaller than the
        window size (which usually happens in the SBAS coverage border), then epochs with discontinuities may be counted more than one, which may
        do that the continuity risk ends up being greater than 1 (this effect can be mitigated by using large time spans). The other disadvantage is that
        if some discontinuities occur but each of them have a duration larger than the window size, the total continuity risk will be much smaller compared
        to the aviation continuity risk, as only the epochs of the size of the window will be counted for the discontinuity, but the other epochs in a
        discontinuity but greater than the window will not be counted. This effect is also maximized as the continuity risk is computed using the
        number of epochs processed, not the number of epochs with solution in PA mode.
        The formula to compute the maritime continuity risk is:

              Maritime Continuity Risk = CTI/MTBF = Window_Size/(NumEpochsProcessed/NumDiscontinuities) = Window_Size*NumDiscontinuities/NumEpochsProcessed

          Where:
           CTF: Continuity Time Interval, which is the window size
           MTBF: Mean Time Between Failures, which is computed as the total epochs processed divided by the number of discontinuities

        This formula is from IALA (International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities), available in the following document:
           http://www.iala-aism.org/product/performance-and-monitoring-of-dgnss-services-in-the-frequency-band-283-5-325khz-1112/
      Maritime mode is configured with parameter '-model:sbasmaritime', which is a shortcut for providing these parameters: '-model:nomt10',
         '-model:nomt2728', '-model:geoswitch', '-filter:maxhdop 4', '-filter:maxpdop 6', '-filter:hdoporpdop', '-summary:hal 100000',
         '-summary:val 100000', '-summary:windowsize 900' and '-summary:windowsizemar 900'.
         Furthermore, parameter '-model:sbasmaritime' will also set maritime options in SBAS plots mode.

  NOTES FOR DOP MAPS:

      When computing the mean and percentile in DOP maps, since version 5.4.0, only the epochs whose protection levels are below the
         alarm limits are used. In version 5.3.0, any epoch with solution, independently of the protection levels, was always taken
         into account for the mean and percentile computation. In this case, if an epoch had a very big DOP (e.g. more than 1 million),
         this value (a clear outlier) would totally bias the mean value to a higher value.

  NOTES FOR SBAS PLOTS:

      See option '-sbasplotsinfo' for detailed help on how to generate SBAS plots.

  NOTES FOR PREFIT OUTLIER DETECTION

      There are two prefit outlier detectors in gLAB:
       - Prefit outlier detector comparing against the median (by default disabled):
          The procedure for this detector is:
           Compute the median of all prefits
           For each satellite:
              Compute absolute value of the difference between the prefit and the median
              If the difference is higher than the threshold, unselect the satellite

       - Prefit outlier detector comparing the absolute values (by default disabled):
          The procedure for this detector is:
           For each satellite available:
             Compute the absolute value of its prefit (ReferencePrefit)
             Set a range for all other satellite prefits defined as:
                Range=[abs(ReferencePrefit)-threshold,abs(ReferencePrefit)+threshold]
                For each satellite (except the reference one):
                  Check if prefits are inside the range
                If half or more of the satellites are invalid, then the current satellite is an outlier
                Else discard the satellites with prefits outside the range.

       If receiver position is fixed, gLAB will allow the outlier detector to discard all satellites in the current epoch.

       If receiver position is not fixed, if more than half of the available satellites are discarded, then, the prefit outlier detector
          will not discard any satellite, as it will assume that the solution still has to converge.

       A recommended value for the thresholds of the prefit outlier detectors is 30 metres

  NOTES FOR DGNSS PROCESSING

    Sigma inflation: During the transient period until the smoother converges, the measurement noise sigma is inflated according
                     to the next equation:
                       Sigma_inflat= f(n)/f(Nstdy) * sigma
                            n<N    f(n)=sqrt(1/n)
                            n>=N   f(n)=sqrt(1/(2*N-1)*(1+((N-1)/N)^(2*(n-N)+1)))
                          where:
                            n:     number of processed samples
                            N:     number of samples of the smoothing window
	                        Nstdy: number of samples when reaching the steady state: In gLAB, Nstdy=(int)(3.6*N)
	                  For instance, with 1 second sampling rate and N=100, the stationary state (Nstdy) is assumed to be reached after 360 seconds
